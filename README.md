Documentation of a reversed no-name USB to Modbus converter. It seems to be using some non-standard automatic DE/NRE handling that I would like to use for my [PiPLC project](https://github.com/chrismettal/piplc) for software that can't use manual DE/NRE switching, light Home Assistant.

A KiCAD project is included, but only for reversing the original PCB, and not to recreate a new one. Though I might change my mind later.
